## 什么是数字花园

>A garden is something in between a personal blog and a wiki. It's a collection of evolving notes, essays, and ideas that aren't strictly organized by their publication date. They're inherently exploratory – posts are linked through contextual associations. They aren't refined or complete - posts can be published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal "blogs" we're used to encountering on the web.

数字花园是介于个人博客和维基之间的东西。这是一个不断发展的笔记、文章和想法的集合，并没有严格按照他们的发表日期组织。它们本质上是探索性的帖子，是通过上下文关联联系起来的。它们不是精炼的、或完整的帖子，可以作为半成品的想法发布，这些想法会随着时间的推移而增长和演变。它们没有我们在网络上经常遇到的[[个人博客]]那么死板、那么有表现力、那么完美。（来源：[[Digital Gardening Tools and Resources|https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners]]）
